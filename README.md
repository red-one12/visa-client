The Library Management System project is a website where users can browse, borrow, and return books. Users can log in or register to access private features, like adding and updating books. The site will be mobile-friendly and secure, with features like book filters, dynamic titles, and notifications for actions. Technologies like React, MongoDB, Firebase, and JWT will be used for building the system.
